<p>My passion for technology, skill in mathematics, and interest of computer hardware have lead me to the field of
Computer Engineering. While going to school I work as a tutor at Mathnasium in Royal Oak, here I am able
to help inspire students of all ages to enjoy math and see it as an awesome tool to describe the world around us.</p>

My main focus during undergrad was as a co-founder of Butler Esports,
during my three-year presidency I helped the organization become recognized on campus by our student government,
grow the organization from it's initial group of ten students to over seventy registered competitors, and
guided the transition from a student organization to a club sport with increased oversight and university investment.
I presented my vision of an esports and gaming center to the board of trustees in late 2019, by the spring of 2020
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIl9jVK0ays">The EGC (Esports and Gaming Center)</a> was being demo'd to test community response for a much
larger <a href="https://esports.butler.edu/butler-university-to-begin-construction-on-new-esports-facility/">esports
commons</a>, which was eventually greenlit in the fall of 2020.
